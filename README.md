This is a complete full-stack project focused on the `backend` that includes a complete `frontend` and `backend` built by myself to put into practice my knowledge of `backend` and `frontend` together.

## API

The `API` of the project is built with `node` and `Expres.js` as a framework. This `API` has some `public` and `private` endpoints. One of the `public` endpoints is [https://mouhametnd-blog-app.up.railway.app/api/blogs](https://mouhametnd-blog-app.up.railway.app/api/blogs) and one of the `private` endpoints is [https://mouhametnd-blog-app.up.railway.app/api/user/blogs](https://mouhametnd-blog-app.up.railway.app/api/user/blogs).

## Database

I used `MongoDB` as a `database` to store the user's account and blogs, as well I used the database to store the result of the `CRUD (create, read, update and delete)` operations.

## Security

This blog app includes `authentication` and `authorization` using `JWT (JSON Web Token)` to authenticate and authorize the user for some endpoints and functionalities. As well I used a library called `bcrypt` to hash the password of the users before storing them in the `database`.

## JSON Schema Validator

I used a library called `jose` that used `AJV (JSON Schema validator)` under the hood to validate the JSON object that we receive from the clients, before manipulating with them.
